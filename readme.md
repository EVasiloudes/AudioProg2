This assignment is designed to let you experiment creatively with some of the basic audio DSP elements we have covered so far. You will submit a single Juce project that uses the Audio Plug-In template to render audio, although the focus will be on the standalone application build target. The application should generate drone music. For us, that means that we can create sounds with a relatively static set of synthesis elements and we donâ€™t necessarily have to worry about constructions such as notes or rhythms (things that would often be determined outside of a plugin in the MIDI data). Make sure you think about how the sound will evolve over time, and draw the ear in to the detail. Note that the software should not be controlled by the user (no sliders, dials, buttons, etc): once the program is running, it develops by itself.
